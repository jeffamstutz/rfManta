       -mtune=cpu-type
           Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated code,
           except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  The
           choices for cpu-type are:

           generic
               Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T
               processors.  If you know the CPU on which your code will run,
               then you should use the corresponding -mtune option instead of
               -mtune=generic.  But, if you do not know exactly what CPU
               users of your application will have, then you should use this
               option.

               As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the
               behavior of this option will change.  Therefore, if you
               upgrade to a newer version of GCC, the code generated
               option will change to reflect the processors that were
               most common when that version of GCC was released.

               There is no -march=generic option because -march indicates the
               instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no generic
               instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
               -mtune indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection
               of processors) for which the code is optimized.

           i386
               Original Intel's i386 CPU.

           i486
               Intel's i486 CPU.  (No scheduling is implemented for this
               chip.)

           i586, pentium
               Intel Pentium CPU with no MMX support.

           pentium-mmx
               Intel PentiumMMX CPU based on Pentium core with MMX
               instruction set support.

           pentiumpro
               Intel PentiumPro CPU.

           i686
               Same as "generic", but when used as "march" option, PentiumPro
               instruction set will be used, so the code will run on all i686
               familly chips.

           pentium2
               Intel Pentium2 CPU based on PentiumPro core with MMX
               instruction set support.

           pentium3, pentium3m
               Intel Pentium3 CPU based on PentiumPro core with MMX and SSE
               instruction set support.

           pentium-m
               Low power version of Intel Pentium3 CPU with MMX, SSE and SSE2
               instruction set support.  Used by Centrino notebooks.

           pentium4, pentium4m
               Intel Pentium4 CPU with MMX, SSE and SSE2 instruction
               set support.

           prescott
               Improved version of Intel Pentium4 CPU with MMX, SSE, SSE2 and
               SSE3 instruction set support.

           nocona
               Improved version of Intel Pentium4 CPU with 64-bit extensions,
               MMX, SSE, SSE2 and SSE3 instruction set support.

           k6  AMD K6 CPU with MMX instruction set support.

           k6-2, k6-3
               Improved versions of AMD K6 CPU with MMX and 3dNOW!
               instruction set support.

           athlon, athlon-tbird
               AMD Athlon CPU with MMX, 3dNOW!, enhanced 3dNOW! and SSE
               prefetch instructions support.

           athlon-4, athlon-xp, athlon-mp
               Improved AMD Athlon CPU with MMX, 3dNOW!, enhanced 3dNOW! and
               full SSE instruction set support.

           k8, opteron, athlon64, athlon-fx
               AMD K8 core based CPUs with x86-64 instruction set support.
               (This supersets MMX, SSE, SSE2, 3dNOW!, enhanced 3dNOW! and
               64-bit instruction set extensions.)

           winchip-c6
               IDT Winchip C6 CPU, dealt in same way as i486 with additional
               MMX instruction set support.

           winchip2
               IDT Winchip2 CPU, dealt in same way as i486 with additional
               MMX and 3dNOW!  instruction set support.

           c3  Via C3 CPU with MMX and 3dNOW! instruction set support.  (No
               scheduling is implemented for this chip.)

           c3-2
               Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set support.  (No
               scheduling is implemented for this chip.)

           While picking a specific cpu-type will schedule things
           appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler will
           not generate any code that does not run on the i386 without
           the -march=cpu-type option being used.
