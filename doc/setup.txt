Most of the rendering components in manta undergo a similar sequence
of calls for setting up the rendering.  This sequence is initiates
during any "structural" change, including changing the number of
processors, changing resolution of any of the image displays, changing
from stereo to non-stereo, and changing and of the rendering
components.

First, the method setupBegin is called with a SetupContext object and a
number of display channels.  Then for each display channel, the method
setupDisplayChannel is called with a different SetupContext object and
a channel index.  The component is responsible for passing the
setupBegin and setupDisplayChannel calls to any components that it
uses.  These setup functions are called by all threads.  The members
"proc" and "numProcs" of SetupContext are used to identify the rank
and size (respectively) of the calling thread.

During setupDisplayChannel, any of the components in the system can
change the resolution of the image or the image pipeline depth.  Any
such changes will cause the setupDisplayChannel method to be called
again with the new information.  This sequence is repeated until the
process converges (i.e. no longer changes the resolution or pipeline
depth). 

At the beginning of the frame, the method setupFrame is called by all
threads.  Again, the components are responsible for calling setupFrame
on any components that it uses.
