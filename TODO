Persistent:
 - Detect self references?
 - Error checking in xmlarchive (err codes from libxml2)
properly handlenamespaces in:
 - read
 - write
 - register
style-sheet like facility for defaults and other things

Cmake:
 - Class rtrt fix
 - Factories
 - New point/vector? - templated on type and dimensionality
 - Nix vector2d...
 - circular dependency from rtrt master to UI - move UI in Engine???
 - configure threads/time classes properly

Color:
 - Special class for just RGB (more efficient???)

Code review:
 - MetalMaterial
 - Box/Cube
 - Sampling

General pipeline structure

Scene 0 bookmarked views

Instances: combine common functionality into instancecommon, TransformInstance
Tighter bounds for difference

BVH: Better builds
BVH: optimized intersect for constant origin, etc.
BVH: vectorize
fix dielectric - no new/delete, other optimizations

Common factory interfaces, registration within each directory...

ruby/swig interface
No proc/numProcs for serial animation callbacks?
Idlemodes:
 - setupFrame needed in IdleMode interface?
 - idlemode done at setup time (idle pipe vs. normal pipe)?
 - abort current frame when interactions appear???

 - different interfaces for different situations - changing from callback, from thirdparty thread, etc.

Channels in all of interface
Separate factories from set in RTRTInterface
numChannels no longer needed in args to setupBegin

Window resize

template <class _Tp>
struct maxf : public binary_function<_Tp,_Tp,_Tp> {
  _Tp operator()(const _Tp& __x, const _Tp& __y) const 
    { return __x < __y ? __y : __x; }
};


void XWindowUI::prockey(unsigned int, unsigned long key)
{
  int value = 1;
  if(key == XStringToKeysym("P"))
    value = -1;
  rtrt_interface->addTransaction("numWorkers",
				 rtrt_interface->numWorkers(),
				 compose1(bind2nd(maxf<int>(), 1),
                                          bind2nd(plus<int>(), value)));
}

autoview - bbox in a transaction
pinhole camera hfov != vfov
Put getCamera() in a transaction????
Camera sets
use quaternions for rotation only transforms?
crash with no display set
verifier in TValue
String ID in TValue???
Nix TValue???
lookover firstFrame flag and setupFrame logic

barrierWait() in rtrt.h????

 - make RENDER_THREAD_STACKSIZE changable through rtrt interface

 - combine transaction_lock and callbacklock???
 - nested instancing - how to do scratchpad????
 - texcoords - transform hitpos instead of rays????
 - CSG
 - checker3
 - bumpmapping?
 - better transform class (or methods) without if test???
 - Redo cube...
 - nested scratchpad
 - acceleration structures
 - Cube: use scratchpad to determine normal?
 - doubles vs. floats???
 - setting eyepoint, shadowmode, other stuff from scenes
 - soft shadows?
 - allow material to optionally override shadow algorithm?
 - frame out of UV, into object?
 - map phong exponent in metalmaterial?
 - should flags get inherited on the way back up?
 - cos_theta duplicate computation in lambertion/noshadows?
 - how to keep track of attenuation?
 - TUNE
 - separate light intersect
 - parallel and incremental preprocessing
 - clean up includes in sphere (notfinished and material.h)
 - comon material class for light stuff
 - rewrite noshadows to allow fuller buffers
 - reduce virtual fns to light in noshadows
 - get rid of hitInfo struct, just use rayPacket?
 - how to do bump mapping (in computeNormal)?
 - implement double-sided lambertian, or a flag?
 - non-vector interfaces for everything???
 - consider moving ambient mode, shadow algorthm, other stuff to raytrcerendercontext : public rendercontext?
 - cvs remove empty .h files
 - stats infrastructure
 - write stats to file?
 - stats on average raypacketsize for primary, shading, shadows, etc.
 - stereo camera, finish stereo support
 - better default scene - use one from rt benchmark?
 - negotiate ray normalization from primitives???
 - Add textures to materials - template?
 - Make bigger sos only for top level dirs?
 - how to do preprocessing - parallel??
 - make Scene a virtual interface???
 - maybe don't reset hitinfo in ctor - make packet do it for only the  ones it needs?
 - crashes if window closes
 - stereo in pixelSampler - what about fragment?
 - switch to stereo visual in stereo mode?
 - Don't do Fragment::element so that they can be vectorized?
 - Don't put frametime in context, use animation callbacks instead? attach/dech?
 - glPixelStore setup for odd sized rgb8 images
 - Use enum instead of or in addition to flags in fragment?
 - progressive sampling
 - poll for events in OpenGLDisplay
 - Input????
 - file bug with SGI over double-free in opengl
 - shutdown problems on local display/SGI
 - worker change callbacks to move contexts...
 - OpenGLDisplay: test when image xres != window xres
 - include guards rtrt->manta
 - check for args in all component ctors
 - how to do overlay information (stats, etc.)
 - finish configure script changes
 - namespace rtrt -> manta
 - Proper arguments for callbacks (proc/nproc, changed flag, etc)
 - Other image types: StridedImage, TiledImage, etc.   Compare performance
 - const correctness, at least in Interface
 - split up RTRT class into multiple interfaces???
 - Memory management for components
 - Complete channel interface - activate/deactivate, remove, etc.
 - How to reconfigure when idle mode changes something?
 - idleChangedCallbacks
 - workersChanged callbacks
 - how to sync callback - not crowdmonitor
 - topend performance optimization
 - traits classes?
 - CSG
 - how to unregister callbacks?


Scene description language?

Group "g1" {
   Sphere {
      center = [0,0,0];
      radius = 1;
      material = "matl1";
   }
}

<scene >
<group name="g1">
   <sphere center="[0,0,0]" radius="1" material="matl1"/>
</group>
